Clear signage and information counters throughout the airport can assist you in finding this location easily.",
        "Travellers going from Changi Airport to Johor Bahru by coach must comply with Malaysian immigration laws. This includes having a valid passport and if required, a visa. Be sure to check the latest visa requirements based on your nationality before departure. Additionally, ensure all travel documents are ready for inspection at the border checkpoint, as you will undergo immigration procedures when entering Malaysia. Most foreign citizens travelling to Malaysia are required to complete the Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC) within three (3) days prior to arrival. Please check if you are exempted from this requirement.",

        "Background:",
        "",
        "Changi Airports International (CAI) was an equity shareholder of Fukuoka International Airport Co., Ltd. (FIAC), the operator of Fukuoka Airport (FUK). FUK is the gateway to Kyushu, a vibrant catchment of 13 million residents in western Japan. FUK is the fourth busiest airport in the country after Narita, Haneda and Kansai airports.",
        "",
        "Problem:",
        "",
        "FUK is a highly slots constrained airport. When Covid-19 hit in early 2020, FIAC had to ensure airlines continued to maintain a high level of slots application. This was to position FUK for the strongest possible recovery, and for optimal future growth when the second runway is operationalised in 2025. Additionally, with flights grounded and low passenger volumes, there was a need to pivot to other sources of revenue.",
        "",
        "Solutions:",
        "CAI helped FIAC strategise and implement creative means of traffic development. This included moving airline engagements online, and creating tourism videos of Kyushu in Mandarin to maintain Chinese airlines’ slots application interests for FUK.",
        "On the commercial front, CAI worked with FIAC to introduce three unique, first-in-Japan, airport products.",
        "",
        "1. Fukuoka Open Top Bus Tour: Paid service that allows locals and tourists access to the FUK airside on an open top bus.",
        "2. Night Wedding Photo Shoots: Paid service that allows couples to take their wedding photos on the tarmac in front of aircraft, during airport curfew hours.",
        "3. Premium Ground Handling Tour: Paid service that brings children and families to FUK’s food catering facility, and FUK airside to learn about ground handling.",
        "",
        "Results:",
        "FUK registered the highest international slots application growth among large Japanese airports during the Covid-19 period, indicating peer outperformance. Post Covid-19, FUK’s international passenger traffic recovered the fastest among large Japanese airports.",
        "New commercial products helped FIAC grow alternative streams of revenues.",
        "New commercial products enabled FIAC to effectively engage the Japanese public even during Covid-19, building goodwill with the community, and positioning FIAC stronger for recovery. Channel NewsAsia reported positively on FUK’s new commercial products in September 2023.",

        "Spanning a massive 1,080 hectares, the Changi East development will provide future capacity for Changi Airport. The development will serve to secure Singapore’s air hub status and ensure its continued competitiveness and relevance.",
        "As Changi Airport’s largest expansion project to date, the development includes:",
        "Terminal 5 is a project undertaken by Changi Airport Group, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, and the Ministry of Transport.\n\nT5 will be linked to the other terminals at Changi Airport, allowing the expanded Changi Airport to be operated as a single, integrated airport for ease of transfer between different terminals with airfield operational efficiency. New facilities, such as navigation aids, airfield lighting systems and a fire station will also be constructed.",
        "The existing third runway, previously used only by the military, has been extended from 2.75km to 4km to handle larger passenger aircraft, and converted for joint military-civilian use.\n\nUnder the three-runway programme, almost 40km of new taxiways will also be built to connect the runway with the rest of Changi Airport. This three-runway system is scheduled for operationalisation by the mid-2020s.",
        "Changi Airport’s cargo facilities, currently located at the Changi Airfreight Centre, will be expanded to the Changi East Industrial Zone (CEIZ) as part of the Changi East Development.\n\nThe zone will be developed for airfreight, air express and Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) activities. Together with the remodelled Changi Airfreight Centre, Changi’s handling capabilities will increase from 3 million tonnes per annum today, to 5.4 million tonnes per annum in its end-state, when the project is completed.",
        "The future expanded air cargo hub will be smarter, more connected and more efficient. The use of data and technology with a focus on automation will reduce processing time, and improve productivity and cargo visibility.\n\nStrategic infrastructure planning will ensure greater operational efficiency, with dedicated lanes for autonomous guided vehicles. Direct access to freighter aircraft from cargo and express terminals will also speed up cargo flows.\n\nWith environmental and workplace sustainability in mind, the new air cargo hub will feature eco-friendly handling equipment, convenient amenities and a land transport network for staff.",
        "Terminal 5 (T5) will be located within the 1,080-hectare Changi East development, and will be able to handle about 50 million passenger movements per year. T5 will be designed with the flexibility to be built in two phases, in line with traffic growth, and is expected to be operational around the mid-2030s. It will secure Singapore’s capacity to ride on the long-term growth of aviation, strengthening Changi Airport’s position as a premier air hub for the region and beyond, and ensuring that future generations of Singaporeans can continue to benefit from Changi’s global connectivity.",
        "",
        "T5 will reinforce Changi Airport’s status as a national icon and ensure that the airport will continue to be a place of shared experiences across generations of Singaporeans, where precious memories are forged with friends and family.",
        "",
        "Drawing on lessons learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic, T5 has been designed with the flexibility to operate as smaller sub-terminals when needed. Specialised provisions to reduce the transmission of diseases will also be deployed in T5, including contactless systems at passenger touchpoints and enhanced ventilation systems.",
        "T5 will be a Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy Building, as certified by the Building and Construction Authority. To reduce its carbon footprint, solar panels; smart building management systems; and district cooling combined with thermal energy storage will be deployed. T5 will also be ready for environmentally friendly solutions such as providing fixed ground power and cooling, as well as viable alternative fuels including the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel for aircraft.",
        "T5 will be designed to accommodate and facilitate the deployment of technology, such as autonomous vehicles and baggage handling robots, to automate and digitalise airport operations, to enhance the passenger experience and increase manpower productivity. This will provide local enterprises with an opportunity to build capabilities in new, emerging areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence, and ultimately create quality jobs for Singaporeans within the airport ecosystem.",

        "H1: Airport Partner in Spotlight: Smarte Carte’s approach to service and staff well-being",
        "H2: Let’s give you the best experience possible",
        "By Nur Aqeelah Batrisyia",
        "Behind one of the world’s most awarded airports is a vast community comprising over 20 airport partners and 50,000 staff, working across diverse functions to deliver the Changi Experience to our passengers. Among these partners is Smarte Carte, a leading multinational corporation specialising in products and services for the travel and leisure industries. At Changi Airport, Smarte Carte is responsible for managing baggage trolleys, baggage storage, and coordinating taxis across all four terminals.",
        "",
        "“Being a part of the airport community is like [being in] a relay race. We’re passing the baton from one point to the next to deliver a seamless experience,” explained Chris Wan, Director of Operations at Smarte Carte. “Every airport partner plays an important role; if any of us do not deliver, the race ends, and the passenger experience is disrupted.”",
        "",
        "The service line of work is challenging, and even more so in the airport environment due to high passenger volume and the diverse needs of each passenger.",
        "",
        "“It’s a challenge to provide good service to passengers every day, but that’s the essence of our business,” said Jessica Chan, Smarte Carte’s Senior Manager of Quality Service and Business Support. “Our focus is on meeting the needs of passengers and visitors at Changi. To succeed, we depend on our strategic service framework and prioritise the well-being of our staff.”",
        "",
        "",
        "Equipping Staff with Service Skills and Encouraging Growth Beyond Comfort Zones",
        "",
        "Smarte Carte has developed a comprehensive framework to improve service delivery for passengers. Their Service Culture Framework is built on four key elements: Service Trainings, Service Initiatives, Service Awards and Recognition, and Service-Driven Communication.",
        "In addition to participating in training programmes organised by CAG’s Quality Service Management team, Smarte Carte conducts its own internal training with a carefully designed curriculum. This curriculum is bite-sized, easy to understand, and tailored to the unique challenges faced by different roles, such as Taxi Coordinators, Trolley Service Officers and Customer Service Officers from Baggage Storage. Recognising that each role involves varying levels of passenger interaction, such contextualised training ensures that the lessons are directly relevant to the unique requirements of each job.",
        "",
        "Responding to challenges observed in staff-passenger interactions, Smarte Carte launched initiatives like the 'Greetings' campaign to encourage staff to improve passenger interactions through regular practice, gathering before their shifts to practise greetings with each other.",
        "",
        "“It can feel very deliberate at first, but once you get used to it, it becomes a habit,” Chris shared. “Our goal is for staff to carry these habits into their daily interactions with passengers. These are the little things we do that we hope can cultivate a service-oriented mindset among our staff.”",
        "In addition to the ‘Greetings’ campaign, Smarte Carte also introduced the ‘Break the Egg’ initiative, which encourages employees to step out of their comfort zone—symbolised by the breaking out of an eggshell—to overcome their reservations and engage confidently with passengers. Staff who successfully complete the programme are given a certificate and a Kinder Joy as a token of encouragement.",
        "",
        "",
        "Winning Hearts Through Food and Goodies",
        "",
        "Driven by the belief that happier employees mean better customer experiences, Smarte Carte places a significant emphasis on staff welfare.",
        "",
        "“You must address the stomach, then you will address the heart,” said Jessica.",
        "Smarte Carte staff are treated to a range of goodies during festive seasons. (PHOTO: Smarte Carte)",

        "Smarte Carte staff are treated to a range of goodies during festive seasons. (PHOTO: Smarte Carte)",
        "Recognising the universal bond created by food, Smarte Carte regularly provides drinks and snacks during their meetings and trainings. During festive seasons like Christmas and National Day, staff receive goodie bags with items ranging from healthy snacks to staff-favourites like bird's nest and chicken essence, all carefully curated to suit the demographics of their team.",
        "",
        "“We have a lot of makan sessions. Buffets are kind of our thing,” Chris chuckled. \"It's a way for us to celebrate diversity and inclusiveness. That's part of our ethos.\"",
        "",
        "Many staff look forward to these buffet gatherings as an opportunity for them to dine with friends who work different shifts. For Smarte Carte, these staff engagements are pivotal. They not only improve employee well-being, but also cultivate a culture where motivated staff strive to enhance passenger experience.",
        "",
        "“Care, service, and excellence. These are the three things we strongly believe in,” said Chris.",

This service is particularly beneficial for those who want to explore the airport’s amenities or simply avoid the last-minute rush. Unlike regular check-in, which opens about 2 to 3 hours before departure, early check-in provides more flexibility and reduces time spent in queues.",
        "Most airlines operating out of Changi Airport offer the option to check in online, allowing passengers to select their seats and print their boarding passes from the convenience of their home or office. However, there are exceptions, and some smaller or charter airlines might not provide this service. Passengers are advised to check with their respective airlines directly for specific online check-in availability.",
        "To complete online check-in for flights departing from Changi Airport, passengers will need their booking reference or ticket number and the passport details of all travellers. Some airlines may also require travellers to enter visa details or other travel documentation depending on their destination. It’s important to have all necessary documents handy at the time of online check-in to ensure a smooth process.",
        "When checking in online, passengers with special needs or additional requests can manage these preferences through the airline’s website. Most airline interfaces offer options to add extra baggage, request assistance at the airport, or make other necessary arrangements. If specific needs aren’t addressed on the online check-in platform, passengers should contact the airline directly to ensure all accommodations are in place before arriving at the airport.",
        "If passengers encounter any difficulties during the online check-in process, it's important to address the issue promptly to ensure a smooth and stress-free journey. Here are the steps you should follow:",
        "By following these steps, passengers can effectively address issues encountered during online check-in, minimising delays and ensuring that their travel plans remain on track.",
        "For passengers who opt for early check-in at the Jewel Early Check-in Lounge, luggage can be conveniently dropped off at the check-in row located within the lounge itself.",
        "However, if passengers choose to check in online, they’ll need to drop off their luggage at their airline’s designated check-in row in the departures hall of the corresponding terminal at Changi Airport. The luggage drop-off service at both locations is typically available from 12 to 24 hours before the flight’s departure, but hours may vary depending on the airline and terminal",
        "After completing Changi Airport’s early check-in process, passengers should first proceed to drop off any  checked baggage at the designated airline counters. Following luggage drop-off, passengers can head straight to the security checkpoint and proceed to immigration. Once cleared, they’re invited to enjoy Changi Airport’s numerous airport eateries and popular outlets in the transit halls.",
        "For those seeking a quiet and comfortable place to relax, Changi Airport’s snooze lounges offer a serene environment where travellers can unwind or catch up on work before their flight. This lounge is equipped with comfortable seating, high-speed internet, and other amenities to enhance your waiting experience at the airport.",

        "在樟宜机场运营的大多数航空公司都提供网上值机服务，方便乘客在家里或办公室提前选择座位、打印登机牌。然而，也有例外，一些小型或包机航空公司可能不提供此项服务。建议旅客直接联系所搭乘航班的航空公司，了解可否线上值机。",
        "对于从樟宜机场出发的航班，要完成线上值机，旅客需要准备好预订参考号、机票编号以及所有旅客的护照详细信息。有些航空公司可能还会要求旅客根据目的地，输入签证详细信息或其他旅行证件。线上值机时一定要准备好所有必要的证件，以便顺利完成值机。",
        "线上值机时，旅客如有特殊需求或额外请求，可以通过航空公司的网站管理这些偏好。大多数航空公司的网站界面都提供添加额外行李、请求机场协助或做出其他必要安排的选项。如果线上值机平台无法满足特定需求，旅客应直接联系航空公司，确保抵达机场之前一切安排妥当。",
        "旅客如在线上值机过程中遇到任何困难，一定要及时解决问题，确保旅途顺利无忧。您需要遵循下列步骤：",
        "遵循上述步骤，旅客可有效解决线上值机时遇到的问题，尽量减少延误，确保旅行计划如期进行。",
        "选择在星耀樟宜提前值机大厅提前值机的旅客，可在大厅内的值机柜台托运行李，非常方便。",
        "然而，如果旅客选择线上值机，则需前往其航空公司指定的樟宜机场相应航站楼离境大厅值机柜台托运行李。这两处通常在航班起飞前 12 至 24 小时提供行李托运服务，但时间可能因航空公司和航站楼而异",
        "完成樟宜机场提前值机后，旅客应先在指定的航空公司柜台放下托运的行李。行李托运后，旅客可直接到安检口，办理出入境手续。完成后，即可体验樟宜机场的众多机场餐馆和离境转机大厅内的人气商品。",
        "如果想找一个安静舒适的地方放松休息，樟宜机场休息区环境宁静，可供旅客放松身心或赶在起飞前完成工作。休息区设有舒适的座椅、高速互联网和其他设施，力求提升您的候机体验。",
